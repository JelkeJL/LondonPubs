            <p>
                Initially, the project started with a data set provided by the "National Brewery Heritage Trust". This set – which was available from <a href="https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?q=europeana_collectionName:(2059528_EU_FD_NBHT)&view=grid&source=reuse" target="_blank">Europeana</a> – consisted of a number of old pictures of pubs in London and environs. As <a href="https://www.historypin.org/en/a-history-of-pubs/geo/51.972827,-0.3574,6/bounds/46.944404,-5.408879,56.494154,4.694079/paging/1/project/about" target = "_blank">Local Pub Histories</a> on historypin.org held rough location data for pubs in the UK, and these were used for the application. The latter also mentions a book made with all the pub photograps, which you can find more about on <a href="https://www.londonlocalpubs.com" target="_blank">londonlocalpubs.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pictures from <em>Europeana</em> were enriched fetching more images from Flickr and additional information from Foursquare. "Local Pub Histories" proved to be a very valuable source in doing this. In addition, NLP techniques were used to extract addresses and keywords from image descriptions, and Microsoft Computervision helped extract relevant tags for all images. This enriching of the data set – and transformation thereof to a usable .json-file – was done by mr. <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00106755" target"_blank">F. Gutiérrez</a>.
