            Hello, my name is Jelke, and I am a student in the advanced master's programme of Digital Humanities at KU Leuven. In my free time I enjoy playing the saxophone and the trombone, and I can often be found volunteering at <a href="https://www.kwikkwak.be" target="_blank">Kwik Kwak</a>, attempting to provide children with entertaining and amusing school vacations.
        </p>   
        <p>
            Before I started studying Digital Humanities, I obtained a Bachelor's and Master's Degree at the University of Antwerp. I completed the BA programme of Literature and Linguistics, specification Dutch and English. The MA programme I followed was that of Linguistics, specification <em>Computational Psycholinguistics</em>.

                Despite not having been to London that often, it is one of my favorite vaction destinations. I only visited the UK's capital city for the first time in 2015, when a friend offered to show me around. Some of the things I enjoy doing the most when I'm there are: seeing musicals, walking around the parks, visiting Camden Stables Market, and meeting up with friends.

                What is nice about the pubs in London is that some of them can be – or at least seem – quite historic. Therefore, visiting pubs in London as a tourist is often not solely about the drinks, but also about the atmosphere. After obtaining a dataset that contained (very) old pictures of pubs in London, the idea to build a recommender web application that could enable a tourist to find out what some old pubs <em>used to</em> look like, seemed to be a fun one.
